# MERN-Stack Learning
This is a project that I made when learning the MERN stack. I followed the video series [Net Ninja- MERN Stack Crash Course Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE) on YouTube when making this project.

# To Run:
## Backend:
- Open a terminal and cd into the backend folder
- Run the command ` npm start ` this will start the backend server
## Frontend:
- Open a terminal and cd into the frontend folder
- Run the command ` npm start ` this will start the development server for the react application

# Note:
- The MongoDB is a local instance so it won't work unless you make it locally as well
