# MERN-Stack Learning
This is a project that I made when learning the MERN stack. I followed the video series [Net Ninja- MERN Stack Crash Course Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE) on YouTube when making this project.

## Technologies Used:
![Mongo](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-a9a9a9?style=for-the-badge&logo=MongoDB)
![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-18191A?style=for-the-badge&logo=Javascript)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-066d89?style=for-the-badge&logo=React)
![Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-303030?style=for-the-badge&logo=Node.js)

## To Run:
### Backend:
- Open a terminal and cd into the backend folder
- Run ` npm install `
- Run the command ` npm start ` this will start the backend server
- ` In the database :) ` should appear in the terminal if everything is correct
### Frontend:
- Open another terminal and cd into the frontend folder
- Run ` npm install `
- Run the command ` npm start ` this will start the development server for the react application
- A new window should appear if everything is correct

## Notes:
- The MongoDB is a local instance so it won't work unless you make it locally as well
